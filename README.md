# Portfolio Template

## First-time setup

##### Getting your own copy of the template

* Click the **Fork** icon in the top-right corner. If you're able to rename it now, rename it to `yourGithubUsername.github.io`. For example, a student with the Github username of _johnd1234_ would change their **Repository name** to `johnd1234.github.io`
* After you have your own copy, on the right sidebar, click the gear icon next to **About** and add a description!
  * For example, _This is a collection of all of my work._

##### Following these directions

* It is recommended that you duplicate this tab so that you can _read_ the directions in one tab, and _follow_ the directions in the other tab. If you want, you can even split-screen them and put them side by side.

##### Updating your username

* If your repo is still named `portfolio-template`, click the **Settings** tab, then change the **Repository name** to `yourGithubUsername.github.io`. For example, a student with the Github username of _johnd1234_ would change their **Repository name** to `johnd1234.github.io`

In the future, you will be editing these files using an IDE. For now, you will be editing these files directly on github.com

* Click `script.js`, then click the pencil icon to edit the file.
* Change line 1 so that the part between the quotes is your name: it can be your first name, first and last name, or first name / last initial. For example, _John_ or _John Doe_ or _John D._ This will be what displays in your navigation bar and tab title of the browser.
* Change line 2 so that it matches your Github username. It must match _exactly_. For example, _johnd1234_
* Click the green **commit** button (then confirm the commit). This will *save* your changes.

##### Uploading your logo

_NOTE 1: It is recommended you rename your logo file to something like_`logo.png`
_NOTE 2: If your file is on Google Drive, you need to download it to the computer first (right-click or control-click the file, then click Download)._

* Click on `yourUsername.github.io` towards the top to get back to the directory of all of the files.
* Click on the folder `img`.
* Click on **Add file** > **Upload files** and upload your logo. Click the green **commit** button.
* Click on `yourUsername.github.io` towards the top to get back to the directory of all of the files.
* Click `index.html`, then click the pencil icon to edit the file.
* Around line 46, you'll see `<img src="img/avatar.png"...`. Change `img/avatar.png` to `img/logo.png` (unless you have a different filename). Make sure you _don't_ delete the part that says `img/`
* Stay on `index.html` for now.

##### Updating your information

* Still on `index.html`, around line 79, you'll see `Lorem ipsum...`. Feel free to change that text to whatever you want!
* Click the green **commit** button.

##### Previewing your site

* In a new tab, go to `yourUserName.github.io` to see the preview of your site!

_NOTE: It may take up to a few minutes in order for your changes to be updated on the preview!_

**You are DONE setting up your portfolio!**

## Customizing

* Feel free to open `style.css` and customize the colors or anything else you want!
* In the future, you will have enough HTML/CSS skills to completely redo the design of this website!

## Adding a new project (in the future)

##### Duplicating the example

* In the `projects` directory, make a copy of `example-project.html`. Name the file whatever you want, i.e. `cyoa.html`.
  * To do this in the command line, simply use `cp example-project.html newFileName.html`
* Customize as needed, using the example starter code and comments to guide you.

##### Adding a link from the home page

* In `index.html` use the example code around line 50 between `<!--` and `-->`. It is recommended that you copy/paste that code, but without the `<!--` and `-->`.
* Make sure you update the `<h5>`, `<h6>`, and `<p>` inner text.
* Update the `<a>` so that `href="projects/yourFileName.html"`

##### Using code snippets

You are welcome to use [Prism](https://github.com/hstatsep/other/blob/main/prism/prism.md) to add code snippets to your portfolio. Prism is already imported into your pages.
