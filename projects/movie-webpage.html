            <h1 class="margin text-center">Movie Webpage Project</h1>
            <h2> Context </h2> 
            <p> After finishing our lessons on basic HTML and CSS, my SEP 10 teacher assigned us our first major projects. We got to 
                work with our partner. This project was meant to help us practice and apply everthing we learned in units 1 and 2,while 
                also giving us alot of creative freedom. We were allowed to choose any movie concept we wanted,as long as we met all the HTML and CSS requirements.
                Like normal SEP assignment,we had to include sepcific elements we needed.  </p>

            <h2> Content</h2>
            <p> For this project,we built a full movie themed webpage using only HTML 
            and css. The HTML portion rquired headings,paragraphs,divs,spans, google fonts, and at least one input with a submit button.
            The CSS portion needed selectors element,class and id. Also the box model padding,margin and border. We also had to use images that were either
            Creative Commons or ones we made ourselves. Before starting, we made plan using markdown where we learn in unit 0. We plan who was in charge
            of what and we could map out our ideas for the story,layout,theme and visual style of the webpage.</p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>One of the main challenges i faced was figuring out why my gradient background kept turning out werid and splitting into different
            pieces instead of appearing as one smooth gradient. At first, i had thought i put in the code wrong or it was a issue with the colors i chose. After
            experimenting , i found that it was a problem with the elements sized on the page. I try out different number for the padding, adjusting its height then 
            getting the gradient looked they way i wanted.</p>

            <p> Another big callenge was organizing the images on the webpage. My partner and i had a general idea of how we wanted them to look,but 
            turning that idea was difficult, as sometimes the images wouldn't allign correctly, or they would stack in a strange way. We had to experiment with things like the 
            display , margin and adjusting image sizes until everything was placed neatly and matched our vision for the webpage. It took patience and
            trials and errors, but eventually we were able to arrange the images in a layout we were happy with.</p>

        
            <h2> Takeaways </h2>
            <p> A major takeaway from this project was the importance of problem solving,communication, and patience when coding. when fixing the gradient
            background and organizing the images made me really look at the code to look for mistakes, testing different things and use my resources 
            to help. I also learned how helpful communication is when working with someone. We relied on each other's strengths, using our strengths we could meet
            all the requirements and make the webpage look complete. The project came together smoothly as we were able to communicate clearly.</p>

            <h2> Next Steps</h2>
            <p> I would continue improving the visual design of the webpage,if i had more time. I'd like to experiment more with the layout ideas, especially
            different ways of arranging images or the texts. I would also want to add more visual elements so the webpage matches the theme even better. Overall, I'm
            proud of the end result. I feel like this project helped me understand HTML and CSS much more deeply.</p>
